License Version 3).

This package contains original code together with modified code fragments
adapted from the following open-source projects:

  • VAST — https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST
  • sdmTMB — https://github.com/sdmTMB/sdmTMB
  • mgcv — https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mgcv
  • brms — https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brms
  • TMB examples — https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/tree/master/tmb_examples

GPL-3 derived components
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following parts of intCPUE contain modified code derived from GPL-3
licensed software.

VAST

Modified code fragments and structural patterns adapted from VAST are used in:

  src/intCPUE.cpp
    spatiotemporal likelihood structure

  R/index.R
    bias-correction workflow

  R/extra-optimization.R
    multi-stage optimization pattern

The statistical model implemented in intCPUE is different from VAST and
is designed for integrated CPUE standardization with preferential sampling.

sdmTMB

Modified helper workflows derived from sdmTMB are used in:

  R/smoothers.R
    mgcv smoother parsing and random-effect conversion

  R/make_mesh.R
    mesh construction workflow patterns

These implementations were adapted for the intCPUE framework and are not
statistically equivalent to sdmTMB.
